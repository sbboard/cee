You might turn a weekly lunchtime into a potluck gathering where a group of teachers share a meal and discuss the curriculum. You might schedule PE or extracurricular activities at the same time as your teaching partner and use that time to meet. Some teachers meet while classroom aides are supervising children outside. Others fit in brief 15-minute discussions on several different days each week.<br/>Too often in schools we devote more time to discussing day-to-day nuts and bolts than we do planning curriculum goals. Trading some of the time ordinarily spent on procedures and using it instead for discussions of big ideas and concepts helps shift the focus to children's learning.<br/><b>How can teachers cover everything in the curriculum if they use this approach?</b><br/>The classroom-ecosystem approach stresses depth over breadth. Therefore you should work in the beginning of the year to carefully select the areas you will spend more time on than others. Examine the curriculum and the science education standards and try to determine which concepts and big ideas will be most meaningful for children. Work with other teachers to eliminate the redundancies that rarely deepen understanding.<br/>When teachers feel pressed to cover everything in the standards, the result is a watered down or disconnected program. If you approach the curriculum in terms of big ideas and concepts rather than topics and themes or isolated facts, you'll be better able to help children make connections and gain in-depth knowledge.<br/><b>Should a teacher ever say \"no\" to an idea or investigation that emerges from the student/s?</b><br/>Yes. A teacher's response to a student's idea or investigation should depend on his or her learning goal for the students. What might they learn from the idea? Does it fit with the science concepts and big ideas? Are there cost or safety concerns that might weigh against implementing this particular idea or investigation?<br/>The fact that students are motivated to come up with ideas and ask questions indicates that the teacher is making science relevant and exciting. One way to determine whether ideas or investigations should be pursued is to ask which of the learning goals they will achieve.<br/><b>How much do teachers need to know about science to teach this way?</b><br/>The stronger the teacher's knowledge of the content area the better he or she can help children build their own understanding. A strong knowledge base can also help teachers be sure of where they want to lead children in terms of the learning goals.<br/>To increase their knowledge, teachers can read books, work with colleagues, use teacher guides or carefully selected internet sites, ask experts to come to the classroom, or attend professional development seminars.<br/>Teachers who use the classroom-ecosystem approach need to see themselves as learners with the children, but they also must stay one step ahead, keeping in mind the concepts. Still, that doesn't mean they need to know it all. In the course of investigations children will come up with challenging questions. Teachers must know where to look for information and be willing to take the time to find it. A very important part of the classroom-ecosystem approach is this dynamic of constant learning on the part of both the teacher and the child."

You might turn a weekly lunchtime into a potluck gathering where a group of teachers share a meal and discuss the curriculum. You might schedule PE or extracurricular activities at the same time as your teaching partner and use that time to meet. Some teachers meet while classroom aides are supervising children outside. Others fit in brief 15-minute discussions on several different days each week.<br/>Too often in schools we devote more time to discussing day-to-day nuts and bolts than we do planning curriculum goals. Trading some of the time ordinarily spent on procedures and using it instead for discussions of big ideas and concepts helps shift the focus to children's learning.<br/><b>How can teachers cover everything in the curriculum if they use this approach?</b><br/>The classroom-ecosystem approach stresses depth over breadth. Therefore you should work in the beginning of the year to carefully select the areas you will spend more time on than others. Examine the curriculum and the science education standards and try to determine which concepts and big ideas will be most meaningful for children. Work with other teachers to eliminate the redundancies that rarely deepen understanding.<br/>When teachers feel pressed to cover everything in the standards, the result is a watered down or disconnected program. If you approach the curriculum in terms of big ideas and concepts rather than topics and themes or isolated facts, you'll be better able to help children make connections and gain in-depth knowledge.<br/><b>Should a teacher ever say \"no\" to an idea or investigation that emerges from the student/s?</b><br/>Yes. A teacher's response to a student's idea or investigation should depend on his or her learning goal for the students. What might they learn from the idea? Does it fit with the science concepts and big ideas? Are there cost or safety concerns that might weigh against implementing this particular idea or investigation?<br/>The fact that students are motivated to come up with ideas and ask questions indicates that the teacher is making science relevant and exciting. One way to determine whether ideas or investigations should be pursued is to ask which of the learning goals they will achieve.<br/><b>How much do teachers need to know about science to teach this way?</b><br/>The stronger the teacher's knowledge of the content area the better he or she can help children build their own understanding. A strong knowledge base can also help teachers be sure of where they want to lead children in terms of the learning goals.<br/>To increase their knowledge, teachers can read books, work with colleagues, use teacher guides or carefully selected internet sites, ask experts to come to the classroom, or attend professional development seminars.<br/>Teachers who use the classroom-ecosystem approach need to see themselves as learners with the children, but they also must stay one step ahead, keeping in mind the concepts. Still, that doesn't mean they need to know it all. In the course of investigations children will come up with challenging questions.

      "more": "<p>Representation is the means by which students demonstrate and communicate their knowledge of big ideas and concepts both to the teacher and to themselves. Students create representations in a variety of ways, including drawing, writing, graphing, sculpting and movement. This work can be categorized into four key formats--oral/textual, kinesthetic, two-dimensional and three-dimensional--each of which offers unique opportunities for children to deepen their understanding. (See General Guidelines for Choosing a Representational Format)</p><p>Deep understanding of a concept includes knowing about its structure, its behavior and its function, or the \"what,\" the \"how,\" and the \"why\" of the concept. For example, to understand the concept \"Simple machines make work easier,\" students must know what are the different parts of the simple machine (structure), how the simple machine works (behavior) and why it makes work easier (function). One type of representation may help students see the \"what\" while another may help them see the \"how.\"</p><p>Additionally, asking children to create multiple representations of concepts and big ideas helps them to synthesize and build knowledge. Offering opportunities to represent concepts in a variety of ways helps to ensure that children with differences in learning style, previous experiences and background knowledge will be engaged and invested in the learning process. At the same time, representation provides important tools for assessing children's understanding and allows the teacher to make informed decisions about instruction. The result is greater effectiveness in addressing children's individual learning needs, which ultimately helps ensure academic success for every child.</p>"
