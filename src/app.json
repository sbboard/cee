You might turn a weekly lunchtime into a potluck gathering where a group of teachers share a meal and discuss the curriculum. You might schedule PE or extracurricular activities at the same time as your teaching partner and use that time to meet. Some teachers meet while classroom aides are supervising children outside. Others fit in brief 15-minute discussions on several different days each week.<br/>Too often in schools we devote more time to discussing day-to-day nuts and bolts than we do planning curriculum goals. Trading some of the time ordinarily spent on procedures and using it instead for discussions of big ideas and concepts helps shift the focus to children's learning.<br/><b>How can teachers cover everything in the curriculum if they use this approach?</b><br/>The classroom-ecosystem approach stresses depth over breadth. Therefore you should work in the beginning of the year to carefully select the areas you will spend more time on than others. Examine the curriculum and the science education standards and try to determine which concepts and big ideas will be most meaningful for children. Work with other teachers to eliminate the redundancies that rarely deepen understanding.<br/>When teachers feel pressed to cover everything in the standards, the result is a watered down or disconnected program. If you approach the curriculum in terms of big ideas and concepts rather than topics and themes or isolated facts, you'll be better able to help children make connections and gain in-depth knowledge.<br/><b>Should a teacher ever say \"no\" to an idea or investigation that emerges from the student/s?</b><br/>Yes. A teacher's response to a student's idea or investigation should depend on his or her learning goal for the students. What might they learn from the idea? Does it fit with the science concepts and big ideas? Are there cost or safety concerns that might weigh against implementing this particular idea or investigation?<br/>The fact that students are motivated to come up with ideas and ask questions indicates that the teacher is making science relevant and exciting. One way to determine whether ideas or investigations should be pursued is to ask which of the learning goals they will achieve.<br/><b>How much do teachers need to know about science to teach this way?</b><br/>The stronger the teacher's knowledge of the content area the better he or she can help children build their own understanding. A strong knowledge base can also help teachers be sure of where they want to lead children in terms of the learning goals.<br/>To increase their knowledge, teachers can read books, work with colleagues, use teacher guides or carefully selected internet sites, ask experts to come to the classroom, or attend professional development seminars.<br/>Teachers who use the classroom-ecosystem approach need to see themselves as learners with the children, but they also must stay one step ahead, keeping in mind the concepts. Still, that doesn't mean they need to know it all. In the course of investigations children will come up with challenging questions. Teachers must know where to look for information and be willing to take the time to find it. A very important part of the classroom-ecosystem approach is this dynamic of constant learning on the part of both the teacher and the child."

You might turn a weekly lunchtime into a potluck gathering where a group of teachers share a meal and discuss the curriculum. You might schedule PE or extracurricular activities at the same time as your teaching partner and use that time to meet. Some teachers meet while classroom aides are supervising children outside.

Trading some of the time ordinarily spent on procedures and using it instead for discussions of big ideas and concepts helps shift the focus to children's learning.<br/><b>How can teachers cover everything in the curriculum if they use this approach?</b><br/>The classroom-ecosystem approach stresses depth over breadth. Therefore you should work in the beginning of the year to carefully select the areas you will spend more time on than others. Examine the curriculum and the science education standards and try to determine which concepts and big ideas will be most meaningful for children. Work with other teachers to eliminate the redundancies that rarely deepen understanding.<br/>When teachers feel pressed to cover everything in the standards, the result is a watered down or disconnected program. If you approach the curriculum in terms of big ideas and concepts rather than topics and themes or isolated facts, you'll be better able to help children make connections and gain in-depth knowledge.<br/><b>Should a teacher ever say \"no\" to an idea or investigation that emerges from the student/s?</b><br/>Yes. A teacher's response to a student's idea or investigation should depend on his or her learning goal for the students. What might they learn from the idea? Does it fit with the science concepts and big ideas? Are there cost or safety concerns that might weigh against implementing this particular idea or investigation?<br/>The fact that students are motivated to come up with ideas and ask questions indicates that the teacher is making science relevant and exciting. One way to determine whether ideas or investigations should be pursued is to ask which of the learning goals they will achieve.<br/><b>How much do teachers need to know about science to teach this way?</b><br/>The stronger the teacher's knowledge of the content area the better he or she can help children build their own understanding. A strong knowledge base can also help teachers be sure of where they want to lead children in terms of the learning goals.<br/>To increase their knowledge, teachers can read books, work with colleagues, use teacher guides or carefully selected internet sites, ask experts to come to the classroom, or attend professional development seminars.<br/>Teachers who use the classroom-ecosystem approach need to see themselves as learners with the children, but they also must stay one step ahead, keeping in mind the concepts. Still, that doesn't mean they need to know it all. In the course of investigations children will come up with challenging questions.

        "theText": "<b>How can I be sure students are learning if there is no teacher or adult at a table?</b><br />The classroom-ecosystem approach to teaching and learning is based on the belief that children are naturally curious and capable of learning independently.<br/>To help ensure that the learning goals are met, set up experiences and materials that are engaging for children and have purpose. Everything on the table should be connected to the concepts and big ideas.<br/>The way teachers put out materials is also important. For example, provide tools such as magnifying glasses to accompany experiences. Set out books with intriguing photos to help children in their research. Make sure there are sharpened pencils and different types of paper for children to use. Inviting materials help engage children in the learning experiences and encourage them to record their ideas and their understanding.<br/><b>When is there time in the day for conversation and discussion? How do I best facilitate them?</b><br/>Children need to have opportunities throughout the day to share their work with the teacher and each other and to discuss their hypotheses, predictions and thoughts for further study. This is when critical thinking and deep learning happen.<br/>After each work time hold a debriefing. Follow firsthand, secondhand and thirdhand experiences and any kind of representation of understanding with a conversation. These conversations can be one-on-one with a teacher or involve the whole group. Whenever possible, include time for both types of discussion.<br/>The best way to facilitate conversation is through asking open-ended questions and allowing children to answer without fear of judgment. For example, ask children: What did you notice? How did this thing compare to that one? What are some things that are similar, different? What if we were to add this? What do you predict will happen? How can you record what happened?<br/>Conversations are most effective when the class is gathered in a common space, such as on the rug, rather than in desks or in rows of chairs. Sitting together in a circle on the rug helps make clear that everyone is a potential contributor and everyone's contribution is valued.<br/><b>How do I encourage students who have a hard time participating in discussions?</b><br/>Each child has something valuable and important to offer the learning community. It's important for teachers to unlock that gift, to find a child's strengths and what really interests her or him. This takes a lot of listening to and observing children, but it pays off in richer, fuller class discussions and deeper understanding of the concepts for all the children. If a child is quiet or reticent, put him in charge of a project he can share and feel proud of. Facilitate conversations so not only the same children are answering. Give quieter children time to answer. Modeling a respectful way to converse helps everyone learn how to be part of a productive work group.<br/><b>What are some ways to build \"community\" in my classroom?</b><br/>Setting up reasonable expectations for behavior and making sure children know what those expectations are helps build a community where everyone takes responsibility for himself or herself and everyone takes on the role of contributor.<br/>In the beginning of the year and throughout the year, talk to children about taking care of their learning environment and keeping it beautiful. Emphasize that each person is an integral part of that. Build in lessons about how to take care of materials by putting caps on markers, cleaning up paintbrushes, putting away supplies, etc.<br/>Model respect for children to help ensure that they will respect you and the other adults and children in the classroom. Even small things such as speaking to children warmly and with respect for their intelligence, displaying their work without added adornment, and giving them the time they need to complete tasks or answer questions help create a constructive community."

They should be able to avoid embarrassment as they interact with their teacher, work without interruption when that is appropriate, ask for help from the teacher, and get help in a timely way, when they need it.

      "benefits": "When the social arrangement of the classroom as a workplace for learning is one in which children feel safe to ask questions and take intellectual risks they become deeper thinkers and more invested learners. Addressing children's individual needs, integrating their ideas into instruction, and encouraging questions helps all children feel they have a contribution to make. As children see their ideas becoming an important part of classroom life, they feel invested in the classroom community and are more open and ready to take on new learning. They develop strong learning morale.",

During the course of his explanation, the child realizes that he doesn't quite understand and he begins to question his reasoning. Rather than criticizing the child for being \"wrong\" or telling him the \"right\" answer, the teacher allows the student time to explain his thinking and helps to scaffold his understanding through inquiry.",

        "theText": "<b>How can I be sure students are learning if there is no teacher or adult at a table?</b><br />The classroom-ecosystem approach to teaching and learning is based on the belief that children are naturally curious and capable of learning independently.<br/>To help ensure that the learning goals are met, set up experiences and materials that are engaging for children and have purpose. Everything on the table should be connected to the concepts and big ideas.<br/>The way teachers put out materials is also important. For example, provide tools such as magnifying glasses to accompany experiences. Set out books with intriguing photos to help children in their research. Make sure there are sharpened pencils and different types of paper for children to use. Inviting materials help engage children in the learning experiences and encourage them to record their ideas and their understanding.<br/><b>When is there time in the day for conversation and discussion? How do I best facilitate them?</b><br/>Children need to have opportunities throughout the day to share their work with the teacher and each other and to discuss their hypotheses, predictions and thoughts for further study. This is when critical thinking and deep learning happen.<br/>After each work time hold a debriefing. Follow firsthand, secondhand and thirdhand experiences and any kind of representation of understanding with a conversation. These conversations can be one-on-one with a teacher or involve the whole group. Whenever possible, include time for both types of discussion.<br/>The best way to facilitate conversation is through asking open-ended questions and allowing children to answer without fear of judgment. For example, ask children: What did you notice? How did this thing compare to that one? What are some things that are similar, different? What if we were to add this? What do you predict will happen? How can you record what happened?<br/>Conversations are most effective when the class is gathered in a common space, such as on the rug, rather than in desks or in rows of chairs. Sitting together in a circle on the rug helps make clear that everyone is a potential contributor and everyone's contribution is valued.<br/><b>How do I encourage students who have a hard time participating in discussions?</b><br/>Each child has something valuable and important to offer the learning community. It's important for teachers to unlock that gift, to find a child's strengths and what really interests her or him. This takes a lot of listening to and observing children, but it pays off in richer, fuller class discussions and deeper understanding of the concepts for all the children. If a child is quiet or reticent, put him in charge of a project he can share and feel proud of. Facilitate conversations so not only the same children are answering. Give quieter children time to answer. Modeling a respectful way to converse helps everyone learn how to be part of a productive work group.<br/><b>What are some ways to build \"community\" in my classroom?</b><br/>Setting up reasonable expectations for behavior and making sure children know what those expectations are helps build a community where everyone takes responsibility for himself or herself and everyone takes on the role of contributor.<br/>In the beginning of the year and throughout the year, talk to children about taking care of their learning environment and keeping it beautiful. Emphasize that each person is an integral part of that. Build in lessons about how to take care of materials by putting caps on markers, cleaning up paintbrushes, putting away supplies, etc.<br/>Model respect for children to help ensure that they will respect you and the other adults and children in the classroom. Even small things such as speaking to children warmly and with respect for their intelligence, displaying their work without added adornment, and giving them the time they need to complete tasks or answer questions help create a constructive community."

Once children have been provided background knowledge either through firsthand or secondhand experiences, they are ready to work with text, which both uses and deepens prior knowledge. The goal in providing children with a variety of experiences is to help them move from novice to expert in their understanding and their ability to apply their knowledge of the concepts."

      "more": "<p>Representation is the means by which students demonstrate and communicate their knowledge of big ideas and concepts both to the teacher and to themselves. Students create representations in a variety of ways, including drawing, writing, graphing, sculpting and movement. This work can be categorized into four key formats--oral/textual, kinesthetic, two-dimensional and three-dimensional--each of which offers unique opportunities for children to deepen their understanding. (See General Guidelines for Choosing a Representational Format)</p><p>Deep understanding of a concept includes knowing about its structure, its behavior and its function, or the \"what,\" the \"how,\" and the \"why\" of the concept. For example, to understand the concept \"Simple machines make work easier,\" students must know what are the different parts of the simple machine (structure), how the simple machine works (behavior) and why it makes work easier (function). One type of representation may help students see the \"what\" while another may help them see the \"how.\"</p><p>Additionally, asking children to create multiple representations of concepts and big ideas helps them to synthesize and build knowledge. Offering opportunities to represent concepts in a variety of ways helps to ensure that children with differences in learning style, previous experiences and background knowledge will be engaged and invested in the learning process. At the same time, representation provides important tools for assessing children's understanding and allows the teacher to make informed decisions about instruction. The result is greater effectiveness in addressing children's individual learning needs, which ultimately helps ensure academic success for every child.</p>"
